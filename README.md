# Update Checker Backend

*What is this good sir?*

I want to make an electron app which notifies you when an update has been released for libraries or languages.
So whenever Nodejs is updated or Angular etc you will be notified. 
This repo will be the backend for the application doing all the check etc, the GUI part will be in another repo.
